Last weekend saw us return to Cardiff for the 9th NHS Hack Day - once again, with organisation 
headed up by the life affirming [Anne Marie Cunningham](https://twitter.com/amcunningham). 

NHS Hack Days are weekend events that bring together patients, healthcare and technology professionals and other 
"geeks who love the NHS" under the banner of making NHS IT less bad. It's always exciting to see people discover
how digital products are made by "Not Magic", not to mention the jaw-dropping that goes on when it gets explained
just how bad much of the status quo really is.

Many of the pitches highlighted the need for quickly and easily customisable hospital systems, that allow
people to collaborate more easily, and also to generate alerts and notifications, routing information that exists
within our institutions to the people who can actually make a difference with it, in time.
