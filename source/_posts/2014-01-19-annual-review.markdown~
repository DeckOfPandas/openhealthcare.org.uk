### OPAL at UCLH

Early in the year we deployed [elCID](https://github.com/openhealthcare/elcid) - our custom built digital service for 
infection doctors to University College London Hospital.

Despite our early plans for a cautious, staggered rollout, demand from end users to transition to the system meant
that we accellerated rapidly, spreading throughout the division of infection at UCLH within the first quarter.



### Hackdays 

2014 saw three more [NHS Hack Days](http:/nhshackday.com) - Cardiff, London and Leeds.
