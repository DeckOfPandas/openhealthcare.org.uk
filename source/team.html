          <p>
            David was born at a very young age. Sometime after that he studied Philosophy,
            before deciding not to worry so much about the meaning of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unrelated to this, he later became a software engineer, where serendipitously enough,
            it turned out that having strong opinions about truthiness, and the logical consistency
            of concepts could actually be of practical use.

          <p>
            Peter is a programmer and writes his software from a shed in at the bottom of his garden in Hertfordshire.
            He likes writing software that makes people's lives easier. When not sitting in front of a screen, he might be found
            up a mountain, in a concert hall, or at a cricket ground.

          <p>
            Ayesha has a background in languages, Arabic and Japanese, but eventually realised that the attraction was in the design of the scripts. She covers all ranges of graphics online and offline, and gets excited about 3D and visual effects for film.
          </p>
          <p>
            She spend a lot of free time being told to stand up straight in flamenco classes and believes everyone should do yoga so we can still stand on our heads when we get old and absorb a chilled out view of the world... except when playing Wipeout on the Playstation.
